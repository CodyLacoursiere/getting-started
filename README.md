# Welcome to the Jankowski Lab!#

This repository is the one-stop shop for figuring out what to learn, where to go, and what to do when getting started in the
Computational Materials Engineering Laboratory.

Research in this lab happens in a lot of places. You'll be using software on your computer,
computer clusters at Boise State, computer clusters at other schools, and managing projects
all over the place.

This document has a checklist for the very very first things you need to,
and then pointers for next steps.

In the beginning, you'll need to get a number of website accounts set up, get a number of computing accounts set up, get access to the lab, and make sure you get paid.


### Websites where you need accounts ###
* <https://bitbucket.org> - This website, where we manage all of our code.
* <https://www.mendeley.com/> - Where we manage references and reading assignments.
* <https://www.dropbox.com/> - File sharing for presentations, figures, reports, etc.
* <https://www.xsede.org/> - Gateway to National supercomputing resources

### Computer accounts ###
* [Request an account on Kestrel](https://secureforms.boisestate.edu/coen/kestrel-cpugpu-cluster-account-request-form/)


### Software  ###


### Getting paid ###

## The initial steps ##
* Vim: `vimtutor`
Run the following command at your terminal command prompt:
```
$ vimtutor
```


* Bash: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
* Git: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/ (This could be skipped and learned on the fly)
* Python: http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
