# Welcome to the Jankowski Lab!#

This repository, and the associated [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/cmelab/getting-started/wiki/Home) is the one-stop shop for figuring out what to learn, where to go, and what to do when getting started in the [Computational Materials Engineering Laboratory](http://coen.boisestate.edu/cmelab/).

#### Helpful Configuration Files ####
We utilize many different tools here, and we have found that the following configuration files are nice to get some of these tools to behave and look the way we want them to.
Having these configurations aren't mandatory, and if you like something else, feel free to change or not use them.

To install all of them, navigate into the config_files directory and simply type:

```
#!bash
$ make
```
